This repository contains six python files in which the main file is main_program.py
and rest five are the included python files for the main_program.py file  which are listed below:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1-Ssh_Bruteforce- This program checks uses the pxssh module built in python for login in the ssh server . in this program we have to enter the username in the python file
                  and the passwords should be listed in the password.txt file .you may add or delete the text in the password.txt file. each password present in the password

2-Reverse_Shell - This program consists of two files one for the server and other for the client the server files bind your system on a selective port and the client 
                  must connect to that port for this you have to edit your Reverse_Shell_Client file and put your ip address in the python file and just run on the 
                  client machine,this python file works well in python3.x .so confirm that the client must be running the python file in the version which is upper 
                  than python 3.

3-Packet_Sniffer - This program uses the basic socket module built in python for sniffing the network traffic passing across your network and counting every packet
                   that are travelling via your network . this also gives the data in the hex form which also includes the ip address /host name of the network 
                   traffic.

4- Chat_server- This program also uses the socket module inbilt in python for the connection with the client and it can be used in intranet or internet for chat within 
                 server and client. run chat_client.py in the client py typing  (Chat_client.py ip-address_of_the_server port) ensure that the port should be same 
                 for the server and the client file
